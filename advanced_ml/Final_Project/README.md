### Forecasting the Cross-Section of Asset Returns

Reproducing this project requires the following modules:

- Python 3.5 
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas_datareader

In addition to the modules listed above, the `all_factors.csv` file must be used to carry out all routines after the **Exploratory Data Analysis** section. This file is too large to store in Github and will be provided separately.
